The provided code is a Python script that uses the Streamlit framework to create a web-based interface for generating technical and theoretical courses using an AI co-pilot. The AI co-pilot is powered by the Langchain library, which utilizes the GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-3.5-turbo-16k model from OpenAI to generate course content based on user prompts.

Here is a brief overview of the code structure and functionality:

1. **Import Statements:**
   - Various Python libraries and modules are imported, including Streamlit, FPDF for PDF generation, langchain for natural language processing, and others.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Some configurations are set, such as Azure Storage connection details, page title, and icon.

3. **Streamlit Page Configuration:**
   - The Streamlit page is configured with a specified title, icon, layout, and initial sidebar state.

4. **Functions for Generating Courses:**
   - Two main functions, `generate_course` and `generate_theoretical_course`, are defined. These functions take parameters related to the course details (e.g., subject, length, difficulty level) and use the Langchain library to interact with the AI co-pilot to generate course content.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The `main` function sets up the Streamlit sidebar, allowing the user to choose between generating technical or theoretical courses. It also enables the selection of the AI model type (GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-3.5-turbo-16k).

6. **Generate Courses Mode:**
   - The `generate_courses_mode` function is called when the user chooses to generate a technical course. It collects user inputs such as course details, and then calls the `generate_course` function.

7. **Generate Theoretical Courses Mode:**
   - Similar to the technical course mode, the `generate_theoretical_courses_mode` function collects user inputs for a theoretical course and calls the `generate_theoretical_course` function.

8. **Streamlit App Execution:**
   - The `main` function is called to run the Streamlit application.

9. **Web Interface:**
   - The Streamlit interface includes a sidebar with options to choose the type of course and model type. Users can input details for the course, and clicking the "Generate Technical Course" or "Generate Theoretical Course" button triggers the corresponding generation function.

10. **PDF Output:**
    - After generating the course content, the script creates a PDF file from the generated text using the FPDF library. The resulting PDF file is then displayed to the user.

It's important to note that some parts of the code are specific to the application's environment, such as the Azure Storage configuration, which may require additional setup in a real-world scenario. Additionally, the code interacts with an AI co-pilot service, and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable needs to be properly configured with a valid API key from OpenAI.
